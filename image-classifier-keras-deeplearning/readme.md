# Image classification wiht Keras
+ Neural network 
- Load image
- 224x224 pixel
- range [0,1] or [â€“1,1]
- reuse pre trained model to build classifier that reach the state of the art accuracy 
- improve classification accuracy is to have a high threshold for accepting a classifier result 
- Reuse CNN pre trained in ImageNet dataset, remove the last few layers and replace with own classifier suited to the task 
- transfer learning : freeze the weights of the original model 

# Building a Custom Classifier in Keras with Transfer Learning
- Fine tuning a convolutional neural network
- Build data pipeline 
    - group multiple images together into batches
    - augment the data 
        - rotation, zooming, increase variation in trainign data
        - reduce overfiting
            - get more data 
            - heavily augment existing data 
            - fine tune fewer layers 
            - combine 

- model 
    - append a new classifier layer 
    - freee weights of original layers 
    - select optimizer algorithm 
- Reuse : multiclassificaion 
- backpropagation 
- rinse & repeat until the prediction become sufficiently accurate 
- batch size : variety of images from different class 
    - fit GPU memory 


- Start train model 
    - fit model to data 
    - epoch - reach 90 % -> last : 97% -> transfer learning 


- Test model

- misprediction 
    - illumination,unclear, background, lack of texture, smaller occupied area,etc
